Silly subprocess experiment
===========================

This is a small experiment using the subprocess Python module
launching two small programs, 'a.py' and 'b.py' talking each
other on their respective stdin/stdout.

In particular, 'a.py' reads from 'b.py' stdout, which in turn
reads from 'a.py' stdout.

The main program is 'run.py' which sets up the pipes and waits
for the completion of the two subprocesses.

The code is released under Public Domain. Do whatever you 
want with it.
